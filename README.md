# I'm setting up my digital notebook

# This repository is my main workspace for backend development in this app development course. I will use it to practice and build backend features like APIs. I will us Node.js to handle requests, manage data, and connect the backend to the frontend. The folders in this repository will be organized by assignments and topics so it is easy to keep track of my work and progress throughout the course.

# My goal for this course is to understand how backend development works and how it supports an application. I want to learn how to create APIs, work with databases, and handle user authentication and security. I also want to improve my skills with error handling, debugging, and writing clean backend code. By the end of the semester, I want to feel comfortable building a complete backend for an app.

# I will use this repository to store all my backend assignments, practice code, and projects for the semester. As I learn new concepts, I will update the repository with new files and improvements. This repository will also help me keep my work organized and show my progress over time as I continue learning backend development.
